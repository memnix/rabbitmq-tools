This is a work in progress and is not ready for production use. Use at your own risk. 
It has been made public to allow for collaboration and feedback from the community. You can use it as a reference for your own tools.

It's not meant to be a replacement for the official rabbitmq package but rather a complement to it that helped us to work with rabbitmq on Memnix.
